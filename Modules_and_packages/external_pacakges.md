# PyPi

> **PyPi** is a repository for open-source third party python packages.
>
>* It is similar to **RubyGems** in the Ruby world, **PHP Packagist**, **CPAN** for Perl and **NPM** for Node.js.
>* There are many libraries that people have open sourced and shared on **PyPi**. They are also known as **Packages**.
>* We can use **pip install** at command line to install these packages.
>* By installing Python from Python.org or through the anaconda.com distribution, we already have **pip** installed in our machine.
>* **Pip** is a simple way to download packages at your command line direclty from the **PyPi repository**.
>* There are packages already created for almost any use case you can think of.
>* A quick google search will usually help you discover a link to the **PyPi** page  for the package or for the package documentation.
