# Booleans are operators that allow you to convey true or false statements 
# Booleans are important when dealing with control flow and logic 
# Boolean values need to be capitalized for the interpreter to understand i.e True, False 
# Booleans are used extensively with comparison operators
True
False
# Check the type using the type() function

print(type(True))

# We can assign a none data type to a varible we want to use later on so as to avoid syntax errors
b = None
# We do not get an error whenever we are calling b 
b  
# We can check the datatype of b
print(type(b)) # Returns NoneType
