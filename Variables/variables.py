Python uses dynamic typing meaning you can reassign variables 
to different data types 

Rules for variable assignments 
1. Names cannot start with a number 
2. There should be no spaces in variable names instead use a _ 
3. Variable names should not use any symbols
4. Its considered best practice to use lowercase when naming variables
5. Avoid using words that have a special meanng in Python
